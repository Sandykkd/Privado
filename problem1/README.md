Problem 1: Create a Timer using JS, HTML and CSS
The UI will have three components.
a.	Text Label at the top: “Privado Timer”
b.	Time Label: Displays the time in “MM:SS” format. Minimum: 00:00, Maximum: 05:00. The “Maximum” value should be configurable.
c.	Button: Three states ( Start, Pause, Reset )


When the user loads the UI, the default page is visible. It has a text label, time label (00:00) and a button ( start ). 
1.	When the user clicks on the “Start” button, the timer starts. The button label changes from “Start” to “Pause”. 
2.	When the user clicks on the “Pause” button, the button label should change to “Start” and the timer should be paused.
3.	When the timer expires ( 5 minutes expiry ), the time should be displayed in “Red Text”. The button label should change from “Start” to “Reset”.
